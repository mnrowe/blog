Welcome to my website. Iâ€™m Matthew, a Senior Information Security Officer from Virginia.

Here I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as Microsoft
Azure, Kubernetes, Cloud Native technologies, Security, DevOps and Linux. I'm also very
interested in anything that increases my productivity, so you will also find
writings on Zettelkasten, (Neo)vim, study techniques and anything that has to do
with taking notes.
